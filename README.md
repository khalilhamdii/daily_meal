## Description

> Daily meal is a React & Redux web app. It's based on a catalog of statistics. It contains a browsable list of meals that you can filter by category or area and access to the recipe of one meal... The data is retrieved from [Meals DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and then stored in the Redux store.
